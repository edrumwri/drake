/**
 * A virtual class providing methods shared by implicit integrators.
 * @tparam T The vector element type, which must be a valid Eigen scalar.
 *
 * This class uses Drake's `-inl.h` pattern.  When seeing linker errors from
 * this class, please refer to https://drake.mit.edu/cxx_inl.html.
 *
 * Instantiated templates for the following kinds of T's are provided:
 *
 * - double
 * - AutoDiffXd
 *
 * The time complexity of implicit integrators is often dominated by the time to
 * form the Jacobian matrix consisting of the partial derivatives of the
 * nonlinear system (of n dimensions, where n is the number of state variables)
 * taken with respect to the partial derivatives of the state variables at
 * `x(t+h)`. For typical numerical differentiation, f will be evaluated n times
 * during the Jacobian formation; if we liberally assume that the derivative
 * function evaluation code runs in `O(n)` time (e.g., as it would for
 * multi-rigid body dynamics without kinematic loops), the asymptotic complexity
 * to form the Jacobian will be `O(n²)`. This Jacobian matrix needs to be formed
 * repeatedly- as often as every time the state variables are updated-
 * during the solution process. Using automatic differentiation replaces the
 * `n` derivative evaluations with what is hopefully a much less expensive
 * process, though the complexity to form the Jacobian matrix is still `O(n²)`.
 * For large `n`, the time complexity may be dominated by the `O(n³)` time
 * required to (repeatedly) solve linear systems problems as part of the
 * nonlinear system solution process.
